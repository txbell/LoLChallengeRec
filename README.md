## Unsolved Problems / Major Hurdles
One big wall I ran into was: When trying to access the API I was using, I would sometimes hit a CORS issue, where my request to the API was blocked by CORS when there was no reason it should be blocked.

## Next Steps:
What I want to do next is add different sorting methods for the recommendations. The site currently sorts based on the challenges closest to leveling up, but there are many other facturs such as highest ranked challenges that would be nice to show.
